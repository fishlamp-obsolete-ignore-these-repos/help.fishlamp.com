title: How To Get The Code
---

#####There are two ways to get the source code:
1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/fishlamp/FishLamp). This means check it out directly from the repository.
> Click [this link](github-mac://openRepo/https://github.com/fishlamp/FishLamp) to clone it now. 

2. Download the [repository](https://github.com/fishlamp/FishLamp) in a zip file. 
> Click [this link](https://github.com/fishlamp/FishLamp/archive/master.zip) to download the zip file now.


#####Some notes on git:

1. If you're a SVN user, git is bit different (and weird at first) so there's a bit of a learning curve. [Here's](http://git-scm.com/course/svn.html) a tutorial on git for SVN users. 

2. I believe OS X might come with git installed, but if so it's an old and crusty version. Either way, you can install the latest git from [here](http://git-scm.com/).

3. You'll need to make a free account on github.com, and then you'll be able to use the [GitHub Mac app](http://mac.github.com/) (or any git client, including the command line) to pull the sources. 
> SVN tip - "Pull" is the git term analogous to "check out" in SVN.

4. A note on tools - The [GitHub Mac app](http://mac.github.com/) is okay, but there's a better app called [Source Tree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) that I recommend. It's more complex, but to me it's easier to use and handles stuff like git submodules. Or you can use the command line (this is how I use git, but I'm old school).

5. If you go to the source [here](https://github.com/fishlamp/FishLamp), you'll see the "clone in desktop" button. That will open the Github mac app (if its installed) and from there you can download the code.
